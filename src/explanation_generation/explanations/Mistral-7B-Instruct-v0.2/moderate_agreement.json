Passage: Internationally, Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at ch\u00e2teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped.

In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at ch\u00e2teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism. Question: What nation was visited for the first time by Victoria in 1849?", "output": "[INST]  [/INST] Explanation 1: The question asks for the nation visited by Victoria in 1849, but the passage mentions that her first visit to France took place in 1843 and 1845. Therefore, the difficulty rating is 1, as the question is asking about a different year than the one provided in the passage.\n\nExplanation 2: The passage states that Victoria's first visit to Ireland took place in 1849, but the question asks for the nation that was visited for the first time by Victoria in that year. Since the passage does not mention any other nations that Victoria visited for the first time in 1849, the difficulty rating is 2, as the question is asking for specific information that is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nExplanation 3: The passage mentions that Victoria made several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, and that she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at ch\u00e2teau d'Eu in Normandy. However, it does not explicitly state that Victoria visited France for the first time during these trips. Therefore, the difficulty rating is 3, as the question requires an understanding of the context and background information provided in the passage.\n\nExplanation 4: The passage states that Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it also mentions that it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism. The question asks for the nation visited, but it does not mention anything about the significance or impact of the visit. Therefore, the difficulty rating is 4, as the question is asking for a straightforward factual answer, but the passage provides some additional context that may be confusing.\n\nExplanation 5: The passage mentions several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, and that Victoria and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I in France in 1843 and 1845. However, it does not explicitly state that Victoria visited France for the first time during these trips. The passage also mentions Victoria's visit to Ireland in 1849, but it does not mention any other nations that she visited that year. Therefore, the difficulty rating is 5, as the question requires an understanding of the context and background information provided in the passage, as well as the ability to distinguish between different visits and their significance."}}, "57263e5189a1e219009ac5ae": {"v2_ambiguity_long_v2": {"prompt": "You will be given a text passage and an associated question.

Passage: The \"Jeltoqsan\" (Kazakh for \"December\") of 1986 were riots in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, sparked by Gorbachev's dismissal of Dinmukhamed Konayev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and an ethnic Kazakh, who was replaced with Gennady Kolbin, an outsider from the Russian SFSR. Demonstrations started in the morning of December 17, 1986, with 200 to 300 students in front of the Central Committee building on Brezhnev Square protesting Konayev's dismissal and replacement by a Russian.

In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator. Following this, Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985. Question: What year was the first Terminator movie released?", "output": "[INST]  [/INST] Explanation 1 (Easy): The question asks for the release year of a specific movie, \"The Terminator,\" which is mentioned clearly in the passage.

However, the passage does provide the release year, so some additional effort is required to extract the information.\n\nExplanation 3 (Moderate): The question asks for the release year of a movie, but the passage mentions the year in a sentence that also includes other information, such as Schwarzenegger's first appearance as the character. This may require some focus and attention to extract the year information.\n\nExplanation 4 (Hard): The question asks for the release year of a movie, but the passage does not provide the year directly. Instead, it mentions the year of Schwarzenegger's first appearance as the character. This requires some knowledge of movie production timelines and the assumption that the release year would be close to or after the production year.\n\nExplanation 5 (Very Hard): The question asks for the release year of a movie, but the passage does not provide the year directly. Instead, it mentions Schwarzenegger's first appearance as the character in a different movie, \"The Terminator,\" which was released in 1984. However, the passage does not mention the release year of \"The Terminator\" explicitly. This requires some additional research or knowledge of movie release dates to answer the question accurately."}}, "5acd59a007355d001abf3e3b": {"v2_difficulty": {"prompt": "You will be given a text passage and an associated question.

Does that mean yes to tax increases as long as he is alive ?", "output": "[INST]  [/INST] Explanation 1 (Politeness Rating: 1):\n\nGeorge Bush's email is written in a colloquial and idiomatic manner, which may not be clear to some recipients. The idiom \"Not over my dead body\" is often used to express strong opposition to a proposal. In this context, it means that Bush will do everything in his power to prevent the tax increases from happening. The ambiguity arises when some people might misinterpret this statement as a confirmation that taxes will indeed increase as long as Bush is alive. However, this is not the intended meaning.\n\nExplanation 2 (Politeness Rating: 2):\n\nThe email may be perceived as slightly impolite due to its use of a double negative, which can make the message less clear than intended. The phrase \"they will not raise your taxes\" followed by \"Not over my dead body\" may create confusion for some readers, who might not be familiar with this idiom or may misinterpret it as a contradiction.\n\nExplanation 3 (Politeness Rating: 3):\n\nThe email may be considered polite if we assume that Bush is using strong language to reassure his audience that he will not allow tax increases to occur. The use of the idiom \"Not over my dead body\" may be seen as a way to emphasize his commitment to preventing tax increases, and the overall tone of the email is one of determination and opposition.\n\nExplanation 4 (Politeness Rating: 4):\n\nThe email may be considered more polite if Bush had taken the time to clarify the meaning of his statement in the email. For example, he could have added a sentence explaining that he will do everything in his power to prevent tax increases, or he could have used a clearer and more straightforward phrase to express his opposition to tax increases.\n\nExplanation 5 (Politeness Rating: 5):\n\nThe email may be considered the most polite if Bush had taken the time to write a clear and unambiguous statement, avoiding the use of idiomatic language and double negatives. For example, he could have written \"I will not allow taxes to be raised\" or \"I strongly oppose any tax increases.\" By using clear and direct language, Bush would have minimized the potential for confusion or misinterpretation, and his message would have been more polite and professional."}, "v2": {"prompt": "You will be given an email from a colleague.
